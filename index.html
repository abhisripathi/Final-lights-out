    <h3>Development Process and Insights</h3>
    <p>The journey of creating the "Revenge of Lights Out" game was an enlightening experience that involved a blend of creative decision-making and problem-solving. 
        <br>The primary goal was to develop an interactive and engaging game that offers a fun challenge to players.</p>
    
    <h4>Creative Choices:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Game Design: The decision to use a 5x5 grid was made to provide a moderate level of difficulty, balancing complexity and accessibility for players of varying skill levels.</li>
        <li>User Interface: A minimalist design approach was chosen for the user interface to keep the focus on the gameplay. This choice was also in line with modern design trends favoring simplicity and usability.</li>
        <li>Feedback Mechanism: The use of a modal window to announce the game's completion was intended to give players a clear and satisfying indication of their success.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Challenges and Solutions:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Randomizing the Board: One of the initial challenges was implementing an effective way to shuffle the board at the start of each game. <br>This was overcome by introducing a randomization function that ensures a new experience in each game session.</li>
        <li>Ensuring Playability: Ensuring that the game was always solvable after shuffling was a complex task. This issue was addressed through careful testing and tweaking of the shuffling algorithm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Insights Gained:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>User-Centric Design: The importance of keeping the user experience at the forefront became clear. Simple, intuitive gameplay and interface design significantly enhance player engagement.</li>
        <li>Testing is Crucial: Rigorous testing was instrumental in identifying and solving gameplay and usability issues, highlighting the importance of thorough testing in game development.</li>
    </ul>
